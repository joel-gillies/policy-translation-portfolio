# Safe Storage of Firearms & Ammunition

Under New Zealand’s Arms Regulations 1992 (Regulation 19), every firearms licence holder must follow strict safe-storage rules to protect others and prevent theft.

## Key Requirements

1. **Keep firearms out of children’s reach.**  
   Store every gun where a child cannot access it.

2. **Separate firearms and ammunition.**  
   Ammunition must always be locked away in a different container from your firearms.

3. **Secure all firearms against theft.**  
   This rule applies to every type of firearm—including flare pistols, humane killers, and stock-marking pistols.

## Approved Storage Options

You must use one of the following on your premises:

- A **fixed lockable cabinet**  
- A **fixed lockable container**  
- A **fixed receptacle** of stout construction  
- A **fixed lockable display cabinet or rack**, with firearms immobilised

> **Tip:** You may also bolt your container into the floor or wall and you must use different keys or keypad codes for firearms versus ammunition.

## Approval & Compliance

- **Police sign-off required:** All your chosen storage steps (firearms and ammunition) must be inspected and approved by a Police officer when your licence is issued.
